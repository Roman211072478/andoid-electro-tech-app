/**
 * Created by Roman on 2016/05/02.
 *
 * Reason for Intent Service
 *
 * My services are used to access the database.
 * A connection is opened to the database when we accessing it, and close when request is done.
 * This limits database interactions makes the application makes one connection to the database
 * at a time.
 * Having a service open a connection twice could result in an error or a delay in application
 * performance. For this reason, intent services on DAOâ€™s are suitable in order for all
 * the services to be queued instead of running at the same time.
 * Separating tasks from the main thread is always a good idea, as it allows the application to
 * keep its performance and whatever happens on the other thread not to affect the main thread.
 * There will be some service which will rely on a previous service in order to populate a
 * value object, which consist of multiple entities.
 * For this reason one would want database access services to be queued.
